            <p>
                Nice to meet you, my name is Paulo,
                I'm a junior back-end developer, currently building applications with php.
                currently focused on using the MVC (model-view-controller) design pattern,
                a love of small technology.
                as I said before, I'm currently focused on php, but I don't just know that, it's just my focus right now.
                I love developing client-side animations with javascript using jquery or building server-side applications using node.js,
                some don't like jquery very much, but I think it's a strong library to this day,
                maybe it's not the best, but it hasn't stopped being useful yet.
            </p>

                    I currently have 2 years of development with php on my own projects, 
                    I currently like to follow a more object-oriented path, I don't really like 
                    the idea of procedural programming, I really like the object-oriented philosophy,
                    I still have some doubts in some cases but I think I'm doing fine.

                    my journey with javascript is a little recent, my start in this technology 
                    was in mid 2021, more specifically in the middle of the year, but it is a 
                    technology that ended up evolving very quickly, both because the language is easy 
                    to learn and because it is very easy to get put into practice, 
                    currently I have some doubts when I'm going to use async and await.

                    I think that like every developer, starts in the world of development through 
                    html and css, at the beginning I always found the idea of ​​making websites amazing, 
                    today I don't see myself with that weight anymore, but I still really like this 
                    fantastic technology, I have the basic knowledge of it, I don't have a 
                    very critical eye to develop beautiful sites, but I do have the necessary 
                    knowledge to work on the back-end and to interact with the front-end to create 
                    dynamic pages.

                    as said in the previous paragraph, I'm not the best person to develop 
                    the css of a page on a website, I don't have so much experience with this 
                    technology but I understand its bases, I think I just lack more experience to 
                    maybe one day have the take a more critical 
                    look at developing better applications with this technology.

                    As every back-end developer, I have knowledge in databases, nothing very deep, 
                    just the knowledge more focused on development, 
                    the databases that I've worked on in projects were mysql, sqlite and sqlServer.
                    I also have a little knowledge of no-sql database I still have many doubts about their use in development 
                    but I know the bases for this type of database.
